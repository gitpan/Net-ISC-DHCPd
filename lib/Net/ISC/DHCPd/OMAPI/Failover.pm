=cut

omapi_attr [qw/partner_port local_port/] => (
    isa => 'Int',
    actions => [qw/examine/],
);

=head2 max_outstanding_updates

Indicates the number of updates that can be outstanding and unacknowledged
at any given time, in this failover relationship.

Actions: examine.

=cut

omapi_attr max_outstanding_updates => (
    isa => Ip,
    actions => [qw/examine/],
);

=head2 mclt

 $self->mclt($int);
 $int = $self->mclt;

Indicates the maximum client lead time in this failover relationship.

Actions: examine.

=cut

omapi_attr mclt => (
    isa => 'Int',
    actions => [qw/examine/],
);

=head2 load_balance_mac_secs

 $self->load_balance_mac_secs($int);
 $int = $self->load_balance_mac_secs;

Indicates the maximum value for the secs field in a client request before
load balancing is bypassed.

Actions: examine.

=cut

omapi_attr load_balance_mac_secs => (
    isa => 'Int',
    actions => [qw/examine/],

=head2 load_balance_hba

 $self->load_balance_hba($str);
 $str = $self->load_balance_hba;

Indicates the load balancing hash bucket array for this failover relationship.

Actions: examine.

=cut

omapi_attr load_balance_hba => (

    actions => [qw/examine/],
);

=head2 local_state

 $self->local_state($int);
 $self->local_state($str);
 $str = $self->local_state;

Indicates the present state of the DHCP server in this failover relationship.
Possible values for state are:

 1  - partner down
 2  - normal
 3  - communications interrupted
 4  - resolution interrupted
 5  - potential conflict
 6  - recover
 7  - recover done
 8  - shutdown
 9  - paused
 10 - startup
 11 - recover wait

In  general it is not a good idea to make changes to this state. However,
in the case that the failover partner is known to be down, it can be
useful to set the DHCP server's failover state to partner down. At this
point the DHCP server will take over service of the failover partner's
leases as soon as possible, and will give out normal leases, not leases
that are restricted by MCLT. If you do put the DHCP server into the
partner-down when the other DHCP server is not in the partner-down state,
but is not reachable, IP address  assignment conflicts are possible, even
likely. Once a server has been put into partner-down mode, its failover
partner must not be brought back online until communication is possible
between the two servers.

Actions: examine, modify.

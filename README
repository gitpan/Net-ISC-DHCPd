NAME
    Net::ISC::DHCPd - Interacts with ISC DHCPd

VERSION
    0.12

SYNOPSIS
        my $dhcpd = Net::ISC::DHCPd->new(
                        config => { file => "path/to/config" },
                        leases => { file => "path/to/leases" },
                        omapi => { key => "some key" },
                    );

        $self->test('config') or die $self->errstr;

    See the tests bundled to this distribution for more examples.

DESCRIPTION
    This namespace contains three semi-separate projects, which this module
    binds together: dhcpd.conf, dhcpd.leases and omapi. It is written with
    Moose which provides classes and roles to represents things like a host,
    a lease or any other thing.

    The distribution as a whole is targeted an audience who configure and/or
    analyze the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server
    <http://www.isc.org/software/dhcp>. If you are not familiar with the
    server, check out the man pages
    <http://www.google.com/search?q=man+dhcpd>.

ATTRIBUTES
  config
    This attribute holds a read-only Net::ISC::DHCPd::Config object. It can
    be set from the constructor, using either an object or a hash-ref. The
    hash-ref will then be passed on to the constructor.

  leases
    This attribute holds a read-only Net::ISC::DHCPd::Leases object. It can
    be set from the constructor, using either an object or a hash-ref. The
    hash-ref will then be passed on to the constructor.

  omapi
    This attribute holds a read-only Net::ISC::DHCPd::OMAPI object. It can
    be set from the constructor, using either an object or a hash-ref. The
    hash-ref will then be passed on to the constructor.

  binary
    This attribute holds a Path::Class::File object to the dhcpd binary. It
    is read-only and the default is "dhcpd3".

  errstr
    Holds the last know error as a plain string.

METHODS
  test
     $bool = $self->test("config");
     $bool = $self->test("leases");

    Will test either the config or leases file. It returns a boolean value
    which indicates if it is valid or not: True means it is valid, while
    false means it is invalid. Check "errstr" on failure - it will contain a
    descriptive string from either this module, $! or the exit value
    (integer stored as a string).

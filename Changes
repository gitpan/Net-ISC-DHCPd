       - Add shared-network can have a name
       - Add Net::ISC::DHCPd::Role::Lease

         from the dhcpd3 binary, instead of the numeric exit value.
       - Change "leases" attribute has auto_deref

       - Add (RT59816) support for "include ...;"
         generate() can either flatten includes or just print the
         "include" statement. parsing of includes is a manual
         operation.

       - Add (RT58391) OMAPI lookup by hardware_address, even though
         it does not appear to described in the dhcpd manual (?)
         Contributor: Jeff Bair
       - Add (RT58391) post check after OMAPI read() to see if lookup
         attributes match retrieved data. This is because omapi/omshell
         seem to have a bug where lease lookup with "state" is ignored.
         This is subject for change!

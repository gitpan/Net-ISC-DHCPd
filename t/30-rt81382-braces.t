# I should note that I found that nested hosts break this.  It's an invalid
# config anyway, but it's not caught and shown as a parse error.  I think this
# is because the second host entry is treated as a keyvalue or block.
# it's seeing the opening brace as part of the (.*) capture and it doesn't see
# the close brace since it's on another line.

# here is a broken example:
# group { next-server 192.168.0.2; host box1 { host
# box1-2 {option host-name "box1-2"; hardware ethernet 66:55:44:33:22:11;
# fixed-address 192.168.0.2; } } }

# so the worst thing we can do is silently generate a bad config.  I consider
# this our failure even though it's garbage-in garbage-out.  Moving away from
# KeyValue to a point where we parse almost everything would allow us to fail
# this properly.

# because of KeyValue and Block I think you could type a letter to your
# parents and it would consider it a valid config as long as it ended with a
# semi-colon.  Not ideal, but again, make sure the input config passes dhcpd
# validation.
